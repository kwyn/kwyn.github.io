## This seems late?
This post was spurred by the many e-mails I receive asking about my experience at Hack Reactor from both strangers, friends, and members of my coed engineering fraternity.

Full disclosure: I worked as a Hacker in Residence (HIR) at Hack Reactor for three months following my graduation date. They've given me multiple Hack Reactor T-shirts and one hoodie. I however am no longer officially affiliated with them, other than wearing my hoodie all the time.

This is my FAQ, followed by a reflection.

## FAQ
### How much does it cost to attend Hack Reactor?
Tuition **$17,780** but this does not include the cost of [housing](#how-much-is-housing-in-sf?)
(It's on their website but since you've come here I'll humor you.)

### How did you pay for it?
I used Upstart, a selective on-line platform that connects investors to individual entrepreneurs, to fund the majority of my Hack Reactor tuition and living expenses (approximately $14k total that I had to come up with up front). I deferred part of the tuition and sold my beloved motorcycle to get the rest of the way.

>Deferral Program: Applicants who would otherwise be unable to attend Hack Reactor work with us on a case-by-case basis to split their tuition into installments that allow you to finish paying a portion of your tuition up to six months after your class has graduated. <cite> [Hack Reactor's Website](http://www.hackreactor.com/program/#yui_3_17_2_1_1426632728607_265) <cite>

Hack Reactor now has [Need blind pricing](http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/announcing-need-blind-admissions-for-hack-reactors-remote-beta-immersion-program) which is a much better deal than Upstart: Contrast five to 10 years of having to pay back 1 to 7% of your income per month (a plan no longer offered by Upstart), versus paying back Hack Reactor for a maximum of one year and only 1.4% of your income per month.

### How much is housing in San Francisco?
Inside of San Francisco the cost of housing is outrageous. Studio apartments frequently go for more than $3,000 per month, and housing is not included in Hack Reactor’s tuition. However, there’s no reason to live by yourself while at Hack Reactor--you’ll only be there for three months, after all!--and I encourage you to find a cheaper situation at a hostel or with a group of other students. I ended up paying about $1,000 per month at a hostel, which is decent but may be difficult to find. I suggest you look many months in advance and network with people in your cohort, and/or call in all family favors, learn to cook, forage, dumpster dive... Point is, do whatever you have to do to make it work--that kind of spirit will serve you well!

I'd also suggest looking in the peninsula and East Bay. Anything along the [BART](http://www.bart.gov/schedules/bystation) l line is doable. You're going to spend most of your time at Hack Reactor, so there’s no need to have lavish living quarters.

### Is the 99% number real?
It's very real and [this response on Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-suspected-reasons-why-some-Hack-Reactor-graduates-the-2-are-unable-to-find-software-engineering-jobs-upon-graduation) sums it up perfectly.

TL;DR. Yes, 99% of people receive a job offer within three months of graduating. The average is also real and graduates often receive six-figure salaries at their first position after HR.

### How was your job search?
TL;DR : It went swimmingly. I worked at one of the upcoming tech giants, then made a job transition to a better culture fit.

The long version: It was stressful, but every job search is stressful. Hack Reactor does a great job of preparing you for interviews and negotiations. I received an offer within the first week after hiring day for more money than I could fathom back then; it was flattering and humbling all at the same time. I received three more offers over the course of my search and started working at Uber, as it was a rocket ship with plenty of room for growth. I ended up leaving, realizing I needed something more nurturing to a young queer trans* persyn. I then joined Technical Machine, a startup that builds a product called [Tessel](https://tessel.io). My position at Tessel is more aligned with my skills and interest in hardware, as well as my personal values.


### How did you prepare for Hack Reactor?
My personal journey prior to attending HR was much more gradual. I had enjoyed programming ever since taking the Intro to Programming courses at UC Merced. I even took C++ for fun my senior year because I wanted to know more. This is the kind of mentality you must have going into Hack Reactor to be wildly successful: One of curiosity, exploration, and the willingness to do something new and scary.

As far as resources to point you to: In order to prepare for Hack Reactor interviews and coursework, I did  [Coderbyte challenges in JavaScript](http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges) up through the intermediate levels and some of the challenging ones and took [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript#jquery-basics) and [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) courses in [JavaScript and jQuery](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript#jquery-basics).

### Reflection (Was it worth it)?
I wouldn't give it up for anything. I've made so many friends I'm sure are going to be life-long, and the network of Hack Reactor students is ever growing. Hack Reactor gave me a rock-solid foundation in coding logic, then taught me how to learn and use most any tool within two days. It's like having a superpower, almost, but nearly everyone has it if they can learn to unlock it.
