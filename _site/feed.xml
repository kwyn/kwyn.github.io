&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-proposition&quot;&gt;The Proposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend Spang had asked me if I would like to do this epic classic climb, Charlotte Dome on Memorial Day weekend, months ahead of time.
Eager to please, wanting to gain more experience climbing on real rock in the backcountry, and the bonus of spending time with the woman I was super stoked about, I said yes even though my cardio and climbing skills were dubious for this trip.
If Spang says I can do it, I believe I can do it, and I could make up with strength for what I lacked in endurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Dome is a great classic climb, however it has a notoriously long approach.
There’s too options for approaches to Charlotte Dome, one is from the East Side which requires a permit for Kearsarge Pass, the other is from the West Side which requires a permit for Bub’s Creek Trail.
7 mile sand 3500 feet of vertical gain to the base of the climb.
Typically done in a 3 day stint hiking out the 6.5 miles and most of the gain, ~2000 feet.
Which leaves 1 mile and 1500 feet of gain to get to the base of the climb.
The climb itself is 10-12 pitches long and another ~1500feet of climbing.
We had packed far too much food and water not knowing how much we could get away with though Bub’s “creek” was roaring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week before the climb I ran around gathering both beta and info, tools and food.
I printed out trail maps and route beta for both of us.
I also planned the timing of the drive up and the food we would eat.
We both weighed our gear cutting weight where we could since 7 miles in was no joke.
I had recently gotten rid of my car so I didn’t have a vehicle to run errands with which lead to this epic photo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-mistake&quot;&gt;First Mistake:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the drive up Spang realized that neither of us had reserved a permit for Bub’s Creek trail.
My heart sank, I was worried we wouldn’t be able to do the trip I’d been looking forward to forward so long.
Swallowing my internal panic I worked with her to lay out our options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Option 1. We do something else.
Feeling the full weight of the sunk cost fallacy I was very much against this option.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Option 2. We wake up early and attempt to be the first ones at the ranger station and hope that there’s some passes left.
This seemed to be the better option though it was dicy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Option 3. We leave super early and bandit camp near the base of the climb.
I didn’t like this option because, in my mind, being caught was mortifying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took option 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we stopped and bandit camped in the General Grant Tree National park &lt;strong&gt;(name check)&lt;/strong&gt;
Woke up early and arrived an hour before the ranger station opened.
It didn’t matter.
There were four parties ahead of us in line waiting for the ranger station to open.
My anxiety levels rose as we waited for the ranger to arrive and as the clock ticked and hours of day light passed.
Every minute we spent here was a minute we weren’t moving towards camp.
I eaves dropped on every conversation ahead of us with the ranger listening if anyone asked for permits for Bub’s creek trail to figure out how many were left.
Finally with only two people ahead of us someone asked about that trail and the ranger shook his head and was like, that’s been booked out for weeks and gave them other options.
Spang and I conferred quietly before hand that we should just get a permit, any permit.
If we were going to break the permit rules we at least better pay the park.
We had never heard of any of our friends getting asked for permits before in the backcountry so we thought we had a good chance of sliding by in spite of the mountains of beta that warned us about the rangers in King’s Canyon.
The ranger gave us an alternative itinerary that sounded awesome that would be a loop through the volcanic lakes and some cross-country bush whacking but it wasn’t climbing and would just be a slog with heavy packs through the back country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t prepare for a backpacking trip we brought minimal gear to cut enough weight to offset the climbing gear.
Parking the car and loading up the gear we talked and decided on what we were going to do.
I had my heart set on this climb, so I insisted we at least give it a try.
What was the worst that could happen?
We get fined and sent back to the trail head with our tails between our legs.
Best case we get to climb Charlotte Dome as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My nerves vibrated with anxiety as we skirted the ranger station and headed up the trail.
What if we get caught?
I hate getting in trouble, I avoided it like the plague when I was little kid.
A teachers pet from day one, this rule breaking felt unlike me.
Our packs were brutally heavy and my cardio was miserably.
We stopped at the river for a snack before heading up the switch backs that we were dreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Kings_Canyon_Backpacks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;River Backpack Kings Canyon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eyed my watch constantly that was hooked up to my heart rate monitor.
On the flats I could keep my heart rate at 120bpm but, as we started up the infamous switch backs on Bub’s creek trail, I couldn’t move at a decent pace without my heart rate spiking to 150+.
Years of olympic lifting has conditioned my muscle to lift this type of weight anaerobically.
I was getting sweaty and and exhausted fast.
The only solace with the brilliant views of King’s Canyon from mid way up the switch back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Kings_Canyon_Valley.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kings Canyon, The Valley Without People&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eyeing ridges and spires that I dreamed I might be able to climb one day, wondering if anyone had ever climbed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Sharktooth_Ridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sharktooth Ridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoying the views I was happy and relaxed for a brief moment until I saw a individual in khakis and a collard green shirt and a badge in the shape of a shield on his left shoulder.
I knew immediately it was a ranger.
We were caught.
He asked for our permit and my heart raced as Spang pulled out the Permit that was for Mariposa Lake
He looked it over and then looked at us how I imagine a parent looks at kid who’s just been caught with their hand in the cookie jar.
I wouldn’t be surprised if I was blushing either.
“Well,” he sighed after he lectured us about why there’s a permit system “I’d like to see you heading back toward the trail head. You have an awesome itinerary here and I think you would still have a good time on it. You should do it.”
We thanked him and put on our heavy packs and trudged back down to the trail head, our feet dragging and our heads hanging a bit lower.
I sat at the trail head honestly trying not to cry, I was so disappointed and exhausted.
Spang rubbed my shoulders and we discussed what we might do.
It was around noon at this point and starting on the other route seemed like a bad idea.
Dead sure that that was our only real option, I was crushed.
Then Spang through out something that hadn’t even crossed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could attempt to do it in a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plan-charlotte-dome-in-a-day&quot;&gt;Plan: Charlotte Dome in a Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while, mulling over the vert gain in my head and thinking about how long it took us to go as far as we did.
Spang assuaged some of my fears by noting that our packs would be nearly 1/4 of the weight and we knew there was water so we could cary even less.
7 miles in with 3500 feet of gain, we estimated the following break down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5-6 hours to get to the base of the climb, and we could do it in the dark since there’s a trail most of the way there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 hours to climb&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 hours to descend and walk out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Hours for any unforeseen events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d start 0200 HRS, get the cut off by sunrise around 0700 HRS perfect for scrambling up an unknown talus field to the base of the climb at 0800 HRS.
Climb and summit around 2pm, we estimated about a 30 minutes per pitch, most of it would be me following.And another 5 hours out, arriving at the car around 1000 HRS. We decided to bring a few extra things to make bivying a bit more comfortable considering that the likelihood of needing to bivy was high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 single rack with a handful of tricams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Harness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Helmets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 sets of climbing shoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 a chocolate bar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 Lara bars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cliff shot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 70 meter rope&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climbing tape&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First aid kit with water purification tablets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Liters of water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Warm silk sleeping bag liner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emergency Blanket&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 pairs of socks (Spang and I use luna sandals as approach shoes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 puffy coats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 patagonia hoodini jackets (ultralight wind breakers)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 R1 fleeces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 headlamps with spare batteries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the day wandering around the outskirts of King’s Canyon.
Keeping our eyes peeled for a pullout that might be good to camp at as close to the national park boundary as possible since it’s illegal to camp in the park without a permit.
After deciding on the plan the day turned around for me, I was excited at the thought of doing this epic thing.
A climb that often took people three days in one really long day. This would be the beginning of my alpine obsession.
We had lunch swam in the river and read “On The Nose” by Hans Florine, dreaming of days when I might be able to simul climb and short fix. While I have no desire to climb the nose I was quite enamored with Spang’s dreams of climbing it one day. We went to bed as soon as the sun went down around 7:30PM getting as much sleep as possible for the long day ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Reading_On_The_Nose.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Reading On The Nose by Hans Florine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up at 2AM, hopped in the car and drove to the trail head.
Dawning our headlamps and gear in the dark parking lot hoping that our car wouldn’t be ticketed, we head out at a brisk pace on the flat before the switch backs.
The approach was very serene with the exception of the roaring Bub’s “Creek” which to me really seemed more like a river.
The sound was quite disconcerting in the dark when you couldn’t see it and when you flashed our headlamp towards it and saw the water rushing by your small view port it was quite horrifying.
We kept our eyes on the trail after that.
We arrived at the way point I had dropped for the cut off from the trail and ate our breakfast snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Dawn_Snacks_Charlotte_Dome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dawn Snacks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrambling up the approach searching for cairns we ended up veering too far right (east) and found ourselves on some pretty serious terrain.
There was a notch at one point that was low fifth class but with a rope in a pack it was difficult for me to get up, it was only my 4 month climbing, there were a few good hand jams and a chock stone as a foot hold that I was afraid of letting loose by stepping on it.
Spang offered rope up for it but I wanted to give it a shot.
I made the hand jam and started to step up on the chock stone when it fell out and went flying down hill.
Dangling by my hand jam I was grateful for my strength and for the fact that no one was below us.
I reset my feet and barely mantled my way up on top the ledge and we made the rest of the way back up to the base of the climb where we found our first problem of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-mistake&quot;&gt;Second Mistake:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a holiday weekend, Memorial Day weekend to be precise.
Climbers were numerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Charlotte_Dome_Start.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Charlotte Dome Start&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were at least 8 people ahead of us two of which were painfully slow.
We had planned on maybe one group ahead of us that we might be able to pass. Spang attempted to negotiate some slab to the right of the “official” start but it was slow going for me and we couldn’t pass the group in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way it didn’t matter, the team at the start of them was slowest of them all and we ended up sharing belay stations frequently. Thankfully the belay stations were cushy ledges that were perfect for naps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Ledge_Nap_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ledge Nap 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cruzed up the rest of the climb whenever the route was finally clear.
The awkward corner and the slot were definitely the cruxes.
In the awkward corner there were so many holds I was glad I had my helmet as some holds made a swing for my face.
The slot is mostly awkward as it’s a pretty vertical wide crack.
Climbing it today would probably not be as bad as I know how to stand on smaller features as well as climb off-widths but at the time it was definitely an challenge.
Everything else was purely just enjoyable with holds abound.
I can’t speak to the gear as I wasn’t leading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually summited around sunset.
Which made for spectacular views but I was worried about trying to get off at night and found myself in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Summit Photos –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Spang_Summit_Sunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spang Summit Sunset&quot; /&gt;
Spang soaking in the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Summit_Sunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Summit Sunset&quot; /&gt;
Spectacular view, but it was unsettling to be summiting so late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-mistake&quot;&gt;Third mistake:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were the two obvious options to descend in the fading light: &lt;br /&gt;
One: bivy at the top, which wasn’t a terrible plan since while we passed the summit block we found a awesome wind protected spot on soft dirt that would be a great candidate for over night bivy with our gear.&lt;br /&gt;
Two: try to find the walk-off which stars as a 4th class down climb&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/Summit_Block.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Summit Block&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this anxiety and panic we didn’t clearly think about the option to get off the top of Charlotte Dome.
As we rounded the summit block we found a rappel station that some one made which went down the side of the dome instead of off the back which is where I believe the walk off decent starts.
We had no idea if there were more rappel stations or where they would be.
We looked trying to see where it would take us and it didn’t look the like the terrain was too terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided rappel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;death-slab-saga&quot;&gt;Death Slab Saga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the key thing was, we did not know where this rappel went or how far we needed to go.
NEVER rappel if you don’t know that there’s another rappel station and the beta has told you that there’s a walk off.
We only had a 70 meter rope. So each rappel could only take us 35 meters at a time.
Which is not a lot considering how tall charlotte dome is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first rappel was easy, there were rap rings and everything. and we landed on a cushy ledge into some trees.
Then we had no where to go.
We traversed left and right hoping to find something that we might rappel off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually came across a fixed line tied off on a robust looking tree.
However the fixed line itself looked core shot but it was our best option.
We tied into the fixed line with a sling into our harness loops and used two locking carabiners to descend the rope so we always had one locked carabiner on the fixed line at all times.
The fixed line eventually ended and we found ourselves in the middle of a endless slab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We traversed around to another flake and climbed down until the slab seemed unmanageable.
We popped a couple nuts into the bottom of the flake and deformed them to an unusable state to make a minimal anchor.
We didn’t want them coming out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$100 dollars, definitely worth our lives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We popped in a couple cams and under a flake since it was too large for nuts to make another anchor anchor and rappelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$200 dollars, still well worth our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again just short of safe.
We then couldn’t go far enough to get to the flat part that was just in sight. Traversing left we eventually found a tree tree that already had a rappel anchor on it.
Clearly we weren’t the first people to make this mistake.
I believe left by the party that went ahead of us.
It was our last rappel then we managed to walk over to the tree line that provided better terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually found a cairn marking the walk off and our spirits lifted a bit.
We started picking our way across trying to find cairns in the dark.
At one point I actually lost our water bladder as my pack kept opening. Meaning we had no water or even a container for water.
The terrain was near impossible to read and we actually passed the original cairn marking the base of the climb but we were too tired to recognize that.
We lost the trail and ended up going down a gully and my energy was waining. My gut told me that the gully was the wrong way.
After expressing that feeling Spang eventually called it and we bivyed under a tree on a bed of pine cones and the rope, our pack as a pillow. We had a relatively comfortable sleep as we cuddled and kept warm in the sleeping bag liner with the emergency blanket over us.
The blanket fit Spang perfectly but was a little small for me and my hand was in the cold a bit so I slept fitfully but was warm enough to not get sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-next-morning&quot;&gt;The Next Morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun eventually dawned and at first light we packed up and with some rest I was thinking more clearly and wanted to go back up to the last cairn now that there was light.
This is when we realized that the large cairn was the cairn for the base of the climb.
With two Lara bars left and half a sandwich and no water we started to pick our way back down.
Some how we eventually found the walk off trail after sliding down some gravel shoots that was simultaneously fun and terrifying.
I was getting dehydrate so we took the plastic bags that our sandwiches were in and filled them with water from the river so I could drink as much as I could.
Spang had to go fetch water for me as I was too tired to do the 5th class down climb to the river just adjacent from the descent trail.
The bag had holes in it but we managed to plug them with our hands.
With water and food I was ready to make the trek back out and was in much better spirits knowing that we would be making it out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long flat trail after the switch backs seemed to never end but I was immensely happy once we got back to the car, loaded up our gear and had a moment to sit and chug water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-drive-back&quot;&gt;The Drive Back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home Spang read more of “On the Nose” to keep me awake as I drove.
We even stopped at my favorite taco place in Merced, &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;J&amp;amp;Rs&lt;/a&gt;, a throw back to my college days.
As we ate dinner Spang and I recapped on the day on what worked well and what didn’t.
The mistakes listed above were the obvious ones.
Though I have left out the things that worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doing Charlotte Dome in a long day is definitely do-able and I would consider it much preferred to the lugging all the gear out there for three days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going light with food and water and knowing the water situation made the trip much more comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bringing cushier bivy gear knowing that the likely hood of bivying was high paid dividends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s definitely an enjoyable day in the backcountry and can be done in without a permit even. So remember&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stick to your plan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do the walk off&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel light&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wake up early&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t go on a holiday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post was spurred by the many e-mails I receive asking about my experience at Hack Reactor from both strangers, friends, and members of my coed engineering fraternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I worked as a Hacker in Residence (HIR) at Hack Reactor for three months following my graduation date. They’ve given me multiple Hack Reactor T-shirts and one hoodie. I however am no longer officially affiliated with them, other than wearing my hoodie all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my FAQ, followed by a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-does-it-cost-to-attend-hack-reactor&quot;&gt;How much does it cost to attend Hack Reactor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuition &lt;strong&gt;$17,780&lt;/strong&gt; but this does not include the cost of &lt;a href=&quot;#how-much-is-housing-in-sf?&quot;&gt;housing&lt;/a&gt;
(It’s on their website but since you’ve come here I’ll humor you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-you-pay-for-it&quot;&gt;How did you pay for it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Upstart, a selective on-line platform that connects investors to individual entrepreneurs, to fund the majority of my Hack Reactor tuition and living expenses (approximately $14k total that I had to come up with up front). I deferred part of the tuition and sold my beloved motorcycle to get the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Deferral Program: Applicants who would otherwise be unable to attend Hack Reactor work with us on a case-by-case basis to split their tuition into installments that allow you to finish paying a portion of your tuition up to six months after your class has graduated. &lt;cite&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackreactor.com/program/#yui_3_17_2_1_1426632728607_265&quot;&gt;Hack Reactor’s Website&lt;/a&gt; &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hack Reactor now has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/announcing-need-blind-admissions-for-hack-reactors-remote-beta-immersion-program&quot;&gt;Need blind pricing&lt;/a&gt; which is a much better deal than Upstart: Contrast five to 10 years of having to pay back 1 to 7% of your income per month (a plan no longer offered by Upstart), versus paying back Hack Reactor for a maximum of one year and only 1.4% of your income per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-is-housing-in-san-francisco&quot;&gt;How much is housing in San Francisco?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside of San Francisco the cost of housing is outrageous. Studio apartments frequently go for more than $3,000 per month, and housing is not included in Hack Reactor’s tuition. However, there’s no reason to live by yourself while at Hack Reactor–you’ll only be there for three months, after all!–and I encourage you to find a cheaper situation at a hostel or with a group of other students. I ended up paying about $1,000 per month at a hostel, which is decent but may be difficult to find. I suggest you look many months in advance and network with people in your cohort, and/or call in all family favors, learn to cook, forage, dumpster dive… Point is, do whatever you have to do to make it work–that kind of spirit will serve you well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also suggest looking in the peninsula and East Bay. Anything along the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bart.gov/schedules/bystation&quot;&gt;BART&lt;/a&gt; l line is doable. You’re going to spend most of your time at Hack Reactor, so there’s no need to have lavish living quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-the-99-number-real&quot;&gt;Is the 99% number real?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very real and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-suspected-reasons-why-some-Hack-Reactor-graduates-the-2-are-unable-to-find-software-engineering-jobs-upon-graduation&quot;&gt;this response on Quora&lt;/a&gt; sums it up perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR. Yes, 99% of people receive a job offer within three months of graduating. The average is also real and graduates often receive six-figure salaries at their first position after HR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-was-your-job-search&quot;&gt;How was your job search?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR : It went swimmingly. I worked at one of the upcoming tech giants, then made a job transition to a better culture fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long version: It was stressful, but every job search is stressful. Hack Reactor does a great job of preparing you for interviews and negotiations. I received an offer within the first week after hiring day for more money than I could fathom back then; it was flattering and humbling all at the same time. I received three more offers over the course of my search and started working at Uber, as it was a rocket ship with plenty of room for growth. I ended up leaving, realizing I needed something more nurturing to a young queer trans* persyn. I then joined Technical Machine, a startup that builds a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://tessel.io&quot;&gt;Tessel&lt;/a&gt;. My position at Tessel is more aligned with my skills and interest in hardware, as well as my personal values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-you-prepare-for-hack-reactor&quot;&gt;How did you prepare for Hack Reactor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal journey prior to attending HR was much more gradual. I had enjoyed programming ever since taking the Intro to Programming courses at UC Merced. I even took C++ for fun my senior year because I wanted to know more. This is the kind of mentality you must have going into Hack Reactor to be wildly successful: One of curiosity, exploration, and the willingness to do something new and scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as resources to point you to: In order to prepare for Hack Reactor interviews and coursework, I did  &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges&quot;&gt;Coderbyte challenges in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; up through the intermediate levels and some of the challenging ones and took &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript#jquery-basics&quot;&gt;Code School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript&quot;&gt;Code Academy&lt;/a&gt; courses in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript#jquery-basics&quot;&gt;JavaScript and jQuery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reflection-was-it-worth-it&quot;&gt;Reflection (Was it worth it)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t give it up for anything. I’ve made so many friends I’m sure are going to be life-long, and the network of Hack Reactor students is ever growing. Hack Reactor gave me a rock-solid foundation in coding logic, then taught me how to learn and use most any tool within two days. It’s like having a superpower, almost, but nearly everyone has it if they can learn to unlock it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Hack Reactor" /><category term="Career Accelerators" /><category term="Coding Bootcamps" /><category term="TechHire" /><summary type="html">This seems late?
This post was spurred by the many e-mails I receive asking about my experience at Hack Reactor from both strangers, friends, and members of my coed engineering fraternity.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/hrx.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">My Experience With Famo.us</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/famous-2048/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Experience With Famo.us" /><published>2014-04-26T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2014-04-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/famous-2048</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/famous-2048/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;in-famous-aka-2048httpblogkwynio2048&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.kwyn.io/20.48/&quot;&gt;2048 in Famo.us aka “20.48”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my hands on the beta for Famo.us. The new hot framework that was just released this past month. I spent a week with it and produced a clone of 2048 found &lt;a href=&quot;http://harleykwyn.com/20.48/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; using pure famous. There is nothing contained in the body of the html file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of the beta release there is relatively slim documentation with somewhat arcane wording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;addressing-the-ux-of-this-implementation&quot;&gt;Addressing the UX of this implementation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point was to make fancy animations and play with the problems of positioning stuff in famo.us when it comes to a simple game like 2048. I spent the lions share of my time porting the 2048 JavaScript source code into the famo.us frame work. I focused mostly on making things move in interesting 3D ways than I was focused on changing colors and updating that. I could continue developing it but it was a toy project and I’m moving on to more interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;require-js&quot;&gt;Require JS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their yeoman file they use as a seed utilizes require.js . I’d never touched require.js before and had only ever heard it being used in Backbone apps. Famous’s entire framework is eerily similar to that of backbone so it does make sense that they would decide to incorporate require.js. This makes it extremely difficult to incorporate existing logic of an app into this seed file that they give you. I managed to figure it out none the less though. However, I think it’s quite possibly an extra layer of complexity that is unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-terminology&quot;&gt;The Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a transitionable? Why is it called a transitionable? Is that word?
Also I’m still uncertain if performant is a word but I suppose it is now. Also a transitionable is basically just a state holder for the surface matrix. Perhaps that’s more confusing to most people but I wish it was described as that to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;architecture-and-syntax&quot;&gt;Architecture and Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax, It reminds me once again of backbone. Every view can have subviews and it’s a bit tricky understanding the paradigm in which you should be programming something. Generally speaking You should only use one context object which is explained in one of the two guides they have out right now. This makes sense to me but having to split up the code based on subviews get quite verbose and bulky and I feel like I’m starting to write in Java instead of JavaScript again with a fleet of files just for a simple 2048 application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is though that ever single Famo.us surface object can have Modifiers pre-pended to them that change what happens to them. You can then subsequently alter these modifiers by referencing them and calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.set*&lt;/code&gt; on them where the * represents some part of the modifier you want to update. Theres some deep layers of complexity here but this is the basics. The most common ones I used ended up being &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.setTransform&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.setOpacity&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.setTransform&lt;/code&gt; because it was the simplest way to move things around and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.setOpacity&lt;/code&gt; because you can’t remove elements in the Famo.us frame work. At least not yet. I’ve heard they’re  working on an elegant solution for this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bind-everything&quot;&gt;BIND EVERYTHING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the architecture comments I have to day I’m not sure if this is a flaw or a feature but it seriously seems like  you need to bind every statement you make when it comes to surfaces. In this sense the backbone like architecture of the file system makes sense so you don’t get jumbled up in different contexts… well javascript contexts not Famo.us contexts… I suppose that’s confusing too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was saying the documentation is just not there yet. It needs a lot of work. It basically tells you what it’s expecting and what it out puts not not always what the function is suppose to do. There’s a physics library but there’s not really any explanation on how to make animations with it and I believe maybe transitionables are involved, whatever those may be. (I jest though. Transitionables are state holders for generally for transform matrices but can be used for anything you need to keep track of.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-render-tree&quot;&gt;The Render Tree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to obscure this factor but I really think they should bring it to the forefront of their documentation. There was at one point a decent guide on their site about what the render tree was and how it works. This is basically how viewing and sub viewing as well as modifiers are organized in the Famo.us frame work. Once this was explained to me it was much simpler to understand how to interact with the library and be able to make intuitive animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eventing&quot;&gt;Eventing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a built in event system that allows you to just simply import one of their eventing objects and use it locally in a view. To communicate between views you have to subscribe to the _.eventInput and _.eventOutput of different views. I didn’t manage to figure out how exactly to use this quite yet as it was a bit confusing and felt a bit verbose. On the other hand you could once again view this as a feature instead of a hindrance because you can ensure that specific events are only listened to by specific views and surfaced and other various JavaScript objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;takeaway&quot;&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Famo.us is providing something that is missing in how it can tie in CSS animations with a physics engine all in an awesome high level language like JavaScript. I’m excited to see more information on the physics parts of their library which is what I think is probably the most promising as I’m uncertain what it provides that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/&quot;&gt;GSAP&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Famo.us is in beta however, so I’m sure there’s great stuff to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2048" /><category term="Famous" /><category term="Famo.us" /><summary type="html">2048 in Famo.us aka “20.48”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/famous.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello World App for Chrome Devtools Extensions</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/chrome-devtools-extensions-hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello World App for Chrome Devtools Extensions" /><published>2014-03-04T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2014-03-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/chrome-devtools-extensions-hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/chrome-devtools-extensions-hello-world/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m attempting to build a visualizer for scope and variable assignment in JavaScript and I wanted to leverage the power of chrome devtools which exposes these in their source panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awesome thing about the chrome developer console is that it is written in JavaScript HTML and CSS, so you can build a web app inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never build a chrome extension before follow these tutorials to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/overview&quot;&gt;Chrome Extensions Overview&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted&quot;&gt;Chrome Extensions Example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve finished those you can start with the hello world app. Here’s some more documentation that may be helpful if you get lost. &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devtools&quot;&gt;Extending Chrome Developer Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going through those first few tutorials you’ll have gathered by now that we at least need a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create dev extension you have to have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;devtools_page&lt;/code&gt; key on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt;. It should looks something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;myFirstDevExtension&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;version&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;0.0.1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;minimum_chrome_version&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;10.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;devtools_page&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;devtools.html&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;manifest_version&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is simple enough. You have to define your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;devtools.html&lt;/code&gt; or whatever you decided to name your html file. Which for hte moment only need to contain a devtools javascript file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;devtools.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;chrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;devtools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;panels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;My Panel&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Panel.html&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;panel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// code invoked on panel creation&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a panel up and running with some html all you need to do is create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Panel.html&lt;/code&gt; file and include whatever you like in it now. You could put cat gifs int here if you’d really like but you should also now have access ot all of your tools through communications between &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Panel.html&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;devtools.js&lt;/code&gt; , and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dectools.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now we can just put a loud and proud &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello World&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can theoretically run an entire angular app within this window. In later posts I may delve more into this and how to use the special devtools available to us within these confines.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Chrome Developer Tools" /><category term="Chrome Extensions" /><category term="Hello World" /><summary type="html">Background

&lt;p&gt;My group at Hack Reactor decided for a short project we would attempt to tackle a Kaggle competition. Specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge&quot;&gt;GalaxyZoo Kaggle competition&lt;/a&gt;. A daunting challenge considering 1. we are new to machine learning. 2. some of us are new to programming and 3. we only have two weeks to work on this specific project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving into researching and reading the forums we found some helpful information and actually found this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/forums/t/6803/beating-the-benchmark&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much effort trying to execute the supposed 20 minute solution referenced on the GalaxyZoo Kaggle competition forums I’ve decided to help complete newbies get up and running with python and the appropriate libraries to execute this solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to cheat, you can jump down to the bottom of the page for the full code but it’d be better if you could try to follow along.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;note: I this is designed for a Unix/MacOSX based setup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the post for beating the benchmark:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Step 1 : for all images in train and test, resize to 50x50, and vectorize to 1-D array.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Step 2: Run the RandomForestRegression from scikit-learn on the train and test set with 10 estimators.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Step 3: Submit Results&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Step 4: You have beaten the benchmark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem with this is that that it assumes you know how to do all of this with a large set of data already. So I’m going to show you how to set up the environment for using Python, scikit-image and scikit-learn.  You may want to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;scikit-image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html&quot;&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/a&gt; documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snake-charming-installing-anaconda&quot;&gt;Snake Charming (Installing Anaconda)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/&quot;&gt;Anaconda&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome python package that contains all of the awesome tools we’ll be using and many others. It’s simpler to run the graphic installer provided by Anaconda and following their instillations instruction rather than writing out all the install commands for every dependency. Be sure to install it for your current user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now be able to run the command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spyder&lt;/code&gt; to open up a python editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1&quot;&gt;Step 1.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-python-file&quot;&gt;Create a python file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get started by creating an empty python file named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MyFirstForest.py&lt;/code&gt; and open it up in your favorite editor. If you don’t have one I suggest spyder as mentioned previously or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-images&quot;&gt;Getting the images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to do this with the Kaggle competition data you can down load it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/data&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; after you make an account and agree to the competition terms. You’ll want to download all of the files and extract them into you workspace directory. Unzipping the image files can take some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first thing you’ll need to do is get a hold of the images which requires the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; module to access the file system so start by typing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at the top of the file. This will import the os utility that allows us to access the file system and other parts of the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave a bit of space and type the following code to actually loop through the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;trainingImages&lt;/code&gt; directory and read each of the images into a variable that we can manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to initialize an empty list that will hold all our training features. I aptly named mine &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#note that this path is absolute path to your training image directory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingImages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'/Users/kwyn/workspace/images_training_rev1/'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;walk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingImages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingImages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;imread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;note that the path for this command is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing\)#Example&quot;&gt;absolute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resize-the-images&quot;&gt;Resize the images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome, so we have our image, but we need to still resize it and we also need to flatten it into a 1D array, where every pixel’s RGB value is an element in the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;skimage.transform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will import the transform.resize utility from the scikit-image library that will allow us to resize the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place the following command after &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;img = io.imread(filePath)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;convert-the-images-into-a-list&quot;&gt;Convert the images into a list&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first we’ll need a list to store our feature lists in. An array of arrays for those of you who don’t speak python. You’ll pick up on it soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;img = resize(img, (50,50))&lt;/code&gt; you’ll want to include the following line to convert the image to a numpy array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arrayOfImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;flatten-the-image-list&quot;&gt;Flatten the image list&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a flattened array though so we need to also flatten this. With python we have handy list comprehensions that will let us do this with single line using the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flattenedArrayOfImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arrayOfImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and lastly append this to the an array you’ll save to run the your algorithms on later with the following line of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to hoist a variable for to store each of these arrays as an array of features that we will feed into our random forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So right after the line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;walk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingImages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll include this line of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;convert-list-to-a-numpy-array&quot;&gt;Convert list to a numpy array&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;scikit-learn methods use the numpy library so we can’t feed it a list we must first convert the tuple list we have just created into a numpy array. To do that we need to have import the numpy feature and alias it to something pretty like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;np&lt;/code&gt;. You want to do that by including the that with the following line after the the imports :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then make sure you write the next line of code out of the loop, to do this you have to make sure that you are not indented at all as python is white space sensitive and then include the following line to convert the list to a numpy array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingFeature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;skimage.transform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resize&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;opening training images&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingImages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'/Users/kwyn/workspace/images_training_rev1/'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;walk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingImages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingImages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;imread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;colorconv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rgb2grey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arrayOfImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flattenedArrayOfImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arrayOfImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flattenedArrayOfImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to repeat this code for the testing data. Just adjust the path name and the variable names for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/code&gt; list to something like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testingFeatures&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re about half way there, keep going!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2&quot;&gt;Step 2.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;load-the-training-data&quot;&gt;Load the training data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training data is given to us in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; format. We can use a numpy module that to read the data directly into a numpy array with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;np.loadtxt&lt;/code&gt; which you can read up on in the numpy documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html&quot;&gt;loadtxt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This following code will load the csv data into a numpy array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/Users/kwyn/workspace/training_solutions_rev1.csv&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numColumns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;readline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;','&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingSolutions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadtxt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pathToTrainingData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;delimiter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;','&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;skiprows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;usecols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numColumns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aren’t interested in the header of the data being included in our numpy array so we remove that and we also exclude the the first columns with the galaxy IDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;train-the-algorithm&quot;&gt;Train the algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for the exciting part! Using scikit-learn to train a random forest on the data. We’ll first need to include the scikit-learn module for random forest regressors. You can do that by including the following with your import commands at the top of the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sklearn.ensemble&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RandomForestRegressor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your interested in delving into what all the parameters mean you can check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html&quot;&gt;sckit-learn documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after all the previous code we will append the following code to actually train our algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rfr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RandomForestRegressor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n_estimators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;max_depth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;max_features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n_jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rfr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingFeatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;trainingSolutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this successfully runs then you’ll have a trained algorithm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saving-your-algorithm-with-joblib&quot;&gt;Saving your algorithm with joblib&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more module that you will most likely want to exploit is called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;joblib&lt;/code&gt; it allows us to directly save python objects and use them later after the script has finished running. In a later post I’ll explain the difference between using this and pickling that is frequently used in python code. You can read more about the module &lt;a href=&quot;http://pythonhosted.org//joblib/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sklearn.externals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;joblib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then right after the lines that train your algorithm write the following code setting the path to a file you wish to save your algorithm in I chose &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Algorithms&lt;/code&gt; for mine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;algorithmName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;myFirstForest&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;joblib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dump&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rfr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Algorthims'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you iterate over different parameters and changing features in the future you’ll probably change the name in  of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;algorithmName&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be sure to create this the Algorithms folder before running the python script&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;running-the-produced-algorithm-on-the-test-data&quot;&gt;Running the produced algorithm on the test data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part is also easy. Just make sure to use joblib to save your prediction somewhere just in case writing to CSV doesn’t go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rfr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testingFeatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;joblib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dump&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Solutions/firstPrediction'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3&quot;&gt;Step 3.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;formatting-the-prediction-data-for-submission&quot;&gt;Formatting the prediction data for submission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kaggle competition expects the csv to be exported in a specific format so so that the tester they have can read the file correctly and perform the error calculations. For this we use numpy’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.savetxt&lt;/code&gt; method. If you want to know more about how this works you can read up on numpys documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savetxt.html&quot;&gt;savetxt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now just copy this code after your predictions have been made&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;galaxyIDs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;galaxyIDs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;astype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;column_stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;galaxyIDs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

My group at Hack Reactor decided for a short project we would attempt to tackle a Kaggle competition. Specifically the GalaxyZoo Kaggle competition. A daunting challenge considering 1. we are new to machine learning. 2. some of us are new to programming and 3. we only have two weeks to work on this specific project.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/blur07.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Machine Learning Work Flow for Hackers</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/machine-learning-work-flow/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Machine Learning Work Flow for Hackers" /><published>2014-02-27T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2014-02-27T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/machine-learning-work-flow</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/machine-learning-work-flow/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a growing field of interest of high demand and tends to appear arcane to even the bravest programmers. However, a hacker can dive into programming just as much as a computer scientist. The key is in the work flow which we will outline in a high level manner in this post. I will go into how to implement the bulk of this work flow with python and Sci-kit libraries in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-devils-in-the-details&quot;&gt;The Devil’s in the Details&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the specifics of the work flow I would like to posit the idea that features are arguably the most important thing when it comes to executing machine learning as a hacker and not a PhD in computer science. We can abstract much of the intricacies of the algorithmic parts of machine learning with libraries such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://mahout.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Mahout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org/&quot;&gt;Sci-kit Learn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Processing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feature Extraction and Selection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing the algorithm (or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;import sklearn&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Training the algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applying the algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-processing&quot;&gt;1. Data Processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is basically putting a label on your data. This task is often outsourced to humans on a large scale for complex image labeling tasks. With raw statistical data generated through website APIs one does not have to deal with image determination. Most of the time as a Hacker you will not be doing this part of the process but it is important to understand that this does have to happen at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For playing around with images &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.image-net.org/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is a handy pre-labeled image database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feature-extraction-and-selection&quot;&gt;2. Feature Extraction and Selection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to asking the right question. Features are metrics or meta data about the label you wish to classify or predict. In this case we’re talking about images. There are many libraries out there for image processing and reduction of dimensionality for features. It just takes a quick Google search. Sci-kit Image is my personal favorite. This is often the most challenging but productive step in the process and frequently requires iteration and mixing combinations of features that are associated with a specific label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some features complement each other and some take away from each other. It’s up to you to determine the secret sauce that makes for the best finished algorithm model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-the-algorithm&quot;&gt;3. Writing the algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re ambitious you can write your own algorithms but as stated before I suggest using libraries. If you want to understand the math that goes into a lot of this stuff you can take a quick coursera course &lt;a href=&quot;https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/lecture/preview&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;training-the-algorithm&quot;&gt;4. Training the algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the easy part. Abstract the actual writing of the algorithm to Sci-kit learn and throw in your properly formatted data and you’re up and running. It’s just a matter of tweaking the parameters to find an optimal algorithm architecture and partitioning your data into training and testing. A 50/50 split between train and test is usually good. You can also run something called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)&quot;&gt;cross-validation&lt;/a&gt; test on the data with your algorithm if you want to get an idea for how accurate the algorithm is over the entire data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the algorithm is trained it will output a function called a model which you will use to predict the label or classification you trained it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;applying-the-algorithm&quot;&gt;5. Applying the algorithm.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply the algorithm model you must also extract features from the test data set in the same way that you did for the training set. Then you can run the algorithm model on the test data to predict the labels or classification of that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repeat&quot;&gt;6. Repeat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluate the difference in the accuracy of your algorithm and iterate over the previous steps tweaking the parameters of the algorithm as well as changing the combination of features or extracting new features from your data. Try to be intelligent and figure out intuitively what features should correlate highly with the specific labels you are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;take-away&quot;&gt;Take Away&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short what you need to worry about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Formatting data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extracting important features and being clever about their correlation to the label of interest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Installing and playing with different algorithms parameters from those libraries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply the model, evaluate benefit of each feature and iterate with the permutations of features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go start hacking!

&lt;p&gt;Without a discussion about what you’re posting your blog isn’t very valueble. Disque can be easy to use but if you’re like me you beleive in google+ and would love to have that as the commenting platform for your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump into how to get this installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure that you have jQuery and the google platforms link included in the scripts at the beginning of your post layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;typically found under your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt; file &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scripts.html&lt;/code&gt; and should look kind of like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;defer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find where you want your comments to appear in your site’s HTML. Preferably the comments will be post specific so it’s most likely to be found in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layout&lt;/code&gt; in something that look like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post.html&lt;/code&gt; and in a wrapper, quite possibly a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tab&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy this div into that container&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;comments&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gapi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'comments'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'624'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;first_party_property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'BLOGGER'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;view_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'FILTERED_POSTMOD'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;setting-up-google-authorship&quot;&gt;Setting up Google Authorship&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for this script to work, Google needs to be sure you’re associated with this page. To do this we need to setup Google Authorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be done by navigating to your Google+ profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top right of the page you’ll see your face! (or a default icon) click on that and then click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/GooglePlusAccount.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google+ Account&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on the left you’ll click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/GooglePlusEdit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google+ Edit Profile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now scroll all the way down to the links section and click edit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/GooglePlusLinks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google+ Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then scroll down to to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Contributor to&lt;/code&gt; section and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;add a custom link&lt;/code&gt; that points to your main domain name or &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;.github.io&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/GooglePlusURL.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google+ Links add URL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great now you’re the author of your blog. Not that you weren’t before, but now you’re ordained by the all might Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;linking-your-google-account-to-your-page&quot;&gt;Linking your Google account to your page&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one last step add a link to your Google+ profile to your page. Using the following code. the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; should be your profile URL + &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?rel=author&lt;/code&gt; otherwise Google will not &lt;em&gt;relate&lt;/em&gt; your authorship to the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://plus.google.com/+YourProfileName?
   rel=author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Google&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice my name in the footer next to the copy write symbol, I went ahead and sneakily put it there in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;footer.html&lt;/code&gt; template. Like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://plus.google.com/+KwynMeagher?rel=author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Kwyn Alice Meagher &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now get commenting!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="github.io" /><category term="github" /><category term="Github Pages" /><category term="tutorials" /><category term="Google" /><category term="comments" /><summary type="html">Last post in this unofficial blog posts about blogging series.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/keyboard_watch.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Recursion Functional vs Closure Part II</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Recursion-vs-closure-part-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recursion Functional vs Closure Part II" /><published>2014-01-28T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2014-01-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Recursion-vs-closure-part-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Recursion-vs-closure-part-2/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue our discussion from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://harleykwyn.com/Recursion-closure-and-iteration/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I’ve decided to run another head ot head test with a functional recursive implementation and a closure scope recursive implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick review of the differences between implementations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion&quot;&gt;Recursion&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures&quot;&gt;closure variable&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of answers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#Functional_recursion&quot;&gt;Functional recursion&lt;/a&gt; which passes in all variables with each recursive call.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iteration which uses a while loop to iterate over all of the possibilities. We’ll leave this one out of the fight for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementations&quot;&gt;Implementations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally both of the following implementations should be executed in 0(n) time. This is mainly to test V8’s (chrome’s javascript engine) handling of functional recursion and closure scope recursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these implementations references a javascript object with keys for all of the numbers and their associated letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;phoneDigitsToLetters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'0'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'ABC'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'DEF'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'GHI'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'JKL'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'MNO'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'PQRS'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'TUV'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'WXYZ'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;functional-recursion&quot;&gt;Functional Recursion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;telephoneWordsFunctional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;digitString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;possibleWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;possibleWords&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;possibleWords&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;digitString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;possibleWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;letters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;phoneDigitsToLetters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;digitString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;digitString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;digitString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;letters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;telephoneWordsFunctional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;digitString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;letters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;possibleWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;possibleWords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Closure Recursion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key difference here is the subroutine we’re wrapping into line 3. This places the possibleWords array outside the scope of the subroutine function which behaves much like the functional recursive implementation above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows the v8 javascript engine to clean up the function calls after they’re finished instead of leaving them open. Scopes in Javascript will not close until they are no longer referenced and if we have to continually pass all of our arguments along, v8 will have to keep all of those instances open. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/p/8eee8afb41df&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; blog post explains this well and how to address this if you want to continue to use functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my computer using chrome the results of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsperf.com/permute-telephone-letters&quot;&gt;perfJS spec&lt;/a&gt; I created show that once again the recursive solution is the most optimal. Closure recursion is approximately as the same difference as last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to run &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsperf.com/tree-map-kwyn&quot;&gt;my perfJS&lt;/a&gt; on your own computer and in different browsers and report back to me what you find!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="recursion" /><category term="algorithms" /><category term="optimization" /><category term="perfJS" /><category term="JavaScript" /><summary type="html">Background</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/the-golden-ratio.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Slick jekyll themes + Github Pages</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/slick-jekyll-themes-and-github-pages/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Slick jekyll themes + Github Pages" /><published>2014-01-26T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2014-01-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/slick-jekyll-themes-and-github-pages</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/slick-jekyll-themes-and-github-pages/">&lt;p&gt;Cool, so you have your custom URL pointing to your github.io page. But it still looks like this.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/StandardJekyll.png&quot; alt=&quot;Out of box Jekyll&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-we-fix-that&quot;&gt;How can we fix that?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well for &lt;del&gt;lazy&lt;/del&gt; clever people like you and me we have our google fu to find themes like &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;. There are many more though so make sure to go explore! Don’t want all of our blogs to look the same after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re starting from scratch we can just fork the repo from the source and then rename the repo to the standard &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;.github.io&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we want to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/herringcove-theme/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll go to the “Home Page” and fork the repo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now rename the repo to your &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;.github.io . To do this just go to the repo settings and replace “herring-cove” with “&lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;.github.io”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;  ~ &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git clone username.github.io
  ~ &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;username.github.io
  ~/username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open up this file and clear out anything you don’t want. Be sure to also recreate your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; file if you’re using a custom URL. This is covered in my previous post in step three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important things to change are removing any default most. I suggest moving them somewhere else to save as templates for later. Possibly in an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_.drafts&lt;/code&gt; folder int he root of your &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;.github.io repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some important things to note are editing your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file so that the url is pointing at your github.io page or custom url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Harley Kwyn Hacking&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Hacking ALL the things&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;http://harleykwyn.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have that basic configuration done then you can edit whatever else you like in the repo and push it to your github page.
Another helpful thing to know is that you can test if your edits will build using you can run jekyll from the local repo file using the following comand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;~/username.github.io jekyll build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you check how it looks on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/code&gt; post if you change the url to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Harley Kwyn Hacking&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Hacking ALL the things&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then run this command in your local repo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;~/username.github.io jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then point your browser at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/code&gt; and you can tinker with it. More on different Jekyll server modes can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/&quot;&gt;Jekyll documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright! go have fun and build some slick looking sites.&lt;/p&gt;

Problem is… that ugly URL up there. &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;.github.io. Wait this is my page! Not github’s…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-we-fix-that&quot;&gt;How can we fix that?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acquire a domain name
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.godaddy.com/&quot;&gt;GoDaddy.com&lt;/a&gt; but there are many &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/5683682/five-best-domain-name-registrars&quot;&gt;other sites&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve heard of some people using NameCheap which may be a better deal now than GoDaddy&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure DNS at GoDaddy.com
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When at GoDaddy navigate to the DNS Zone File of the domain page you want to point to your github.io page.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Click Edit and add two “A (host)”” to point to 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154 like the following image &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/GoDaddyZoneFile1.png&quot; alt=&quot;GoDaddyZoneFile1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;set the www alias to point to your &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;.github.io like the following image &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/GoDaddyZoneFile2.png&quot; alt=&quot;GoDaddyZoneFile2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a CNAME file in your &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;.github.io repo
CNAME file should point to your domain name this is easily done in the root of your directory with something like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; KwynsMacPro: HarleyKwyn.github.io kwyn&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;harleykwyn.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; CNAME
   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then just push your changes and you’re done and on your way! Happy blogging. :)&lt;/p&gt;
